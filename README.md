### Bamazon

Welcome to Bamazon! This is a command-line marketplace that tracks inventory of products and updates them in a database. Refer to this 

[photo](photos/bamazon.png) for an overview of how it works. [Here](photos/bamazonsql.png) is a picture of the SQL table.

When you run the application, a table will be printed with the available products. You will be prompted to enter the ID of a product 

you would like to purchase as well as the number of units you would like to purchase. If there is enough inventory to fulfill your 

order, you will be asked to confirm the purchase price otherwise you will be asked to select a new product. If you choose not to 

continue shopping, you will exit the app.
